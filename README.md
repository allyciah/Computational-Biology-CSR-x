# Gene Expression Machine Learning Marfan Syndrome 
This project uses gene expression data to build machine learning models that help classify Marfan syndrome versus healthy samples.

Research Question: How accurately can machine learning models classify Marfan Syndrome from healthy individuals based on the gene expression of immune-related genes?

Goals: 
- Clean and preprocess RNA sequence data
- Visualize key gene expression trends
- Build classifers using scikit-learn
- Interpret biological significance of results

Tools:
- Python(pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

Repository Structure:
- 'notebooks/': Colab notebooks
- 'data/': Data files or data instructions
- 'scripts/': Standalone scripts
- 'results/': Outputs, graphs, predictions

How to Run:
1. Open the notebooks in Google Colab
2. Install dependencies w/ 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Follow notebook instructions

Note to Mentees:
- Always pull before pushing, if this process is necessary
- Write clear commit messages (these serve as a record of changes made to the codebase, ex: cleaned missing values)
